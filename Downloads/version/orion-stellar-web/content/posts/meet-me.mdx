## What is a Meet-Me Room?

A meet-me room (MMR) is a secure place where customers can choose to connect to one or more carriers since Meet-Me Room space is dedicated for cable companies, ISPs, and other providers to cross-connect with tenants in the data center. Meet-Me Room can be called as Telco Room. 
In OrionStellar Data Center we have 02 Telco Rooms (Telco Room A & Telco Room B) connected in ring fashion offering the customers with a wider choice of SLT, Dialog and Lanka Bell.  With Meet-Me Room concept, OSDC ensures our business clients with a reliable, low-latency connection with the reduced network cost.
 
As mentioned, Meet-Me Room is an important component in the modern-day data center which usually consists of cabinets and racks with carriers’ hardware that allows quick and reliable data transfer and physically connects hundreds of different companies and ISPs located within the same facility through which the internet exchange possible.


## How Data Exchange works in a Meet-Me Room?

An Internet Service Provider (ISP) is required to send out data to the Internet. Data exchange between two organizations in different geographical locations, happens through a global ISP. One system first exchanges the information with the ISP so that the data packets will be routed to the target system. 

However, in the case of two organizations geographically closer to each other, they can physically connect. A meet-me room in a data center facilitates the two systems to exchange information directly.

Hence, with the Meet-Me Room concept, data packets will not travel to the ISP’s main network and back thus the traffic will be largely eliminated making data transfer secured and cost effective.


## Career-Neutral Meet-Me Rooms at OSDC

All colocation data centers house an MMR. However, OrionStellar Data center is the first to go career-Neutral in Sri Lanka, which means there is a wide-ranging selection of network providers for tenants to choose from. Dialog, SLT, Lanka Bell are the three main network providers in Sri Lanka and all three are available at OrionStellar Data center, in our two meet-me room facilities connected in a ring fashion.

## Benefits for the customer 

Hence, by having multiple choices for providers, customers can improve flexibility, redundancy, and optimize their connection. 

The customer is offered with reduced latency with high bandwidth while eliminating network hops. 

The prices are competitive, and carriers bypass local loop charges results reduced prices for the customer. 

Carrier neutral data centers can bring more carriers and expand their offering, hence quick expansion is possible.


## Meet -Me Room Security & Access

Since the security is a top priority for a Meet-Me Room, these areas are encased in fire-rated walls, highly secured with constant monitoring and restricted access. Multi-factor authentication at OrionStellar avoids any unauthorized personnel from entering the MMR space. Further, CCTV cameras record every movement in the room. With a 24/7 surveillance system and biometric scans, the security is maintained to the best standards.


## The Design of Meet-Me Room

The design of the Meet-Me Room is vital since the thoughtful designs offer huge efficiency and marginal benefits for operations. OrionStellar Data center has two Meet-Me Rooms

Telco Room A is a 32 square meters while Telco Room B is 24 square meters  

Both Telco Rooms provide sufficient expansion space for new carriers so that the potential clients avoid leasing space within a data center that cannot accommodate new ISPs. 
Also, we offer 45U cabinets for carriers and network providers’ equipment. MMRs usually have either AC or DC power options and the design ensure more space for additional carrier equipment.

Cooling is a crucial part of the Meet -Me Room hence it is important to consider what type of equipment carriers will be installed in the meet-me room. We, OrionStellar have ensures with the high-performance cooling units that keep MMR temperature within acceptable ranges.
Data Centers usually allow careers to their Meet-Me Room through a fiber cable from the street to the cross-connect room. One option is through meet-me vaults, which can be also referred as meet-me boxes. These infrastructure points are crucial as to ensure a secured carrier access to the facility. Appropriate planning can allow a high number of providers to the data center.
A meet-me vault is a concrete box for carriers’ fiber optic entry into the facility. Achieving maximum redundancy requires more than one vault. Hence, multiple points of entry and well-positioned meet-me vaults attract more providers.

OrionStellar with its careful designing has been able to allows several providers to bring high bandwidth connection without sharing the ducts. From meet-me vaults, cables go into the cross-connect room through reinforced trenches. The cross-connect room can be referred to as a strong fiber entry point where carriers connect to customers.
With the most appropriate design and technology in our Meet-Me Rooms, OrionStellar Data Center ensures the uninterrupted Internet exchange and smooth transmission of data between tenants and carriers
