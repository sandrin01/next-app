Colocation hosting is one of the main infrastructure services offered by a data center. Colocation in simple terms means that the Data center leases space and provides housing for servers being responsible for maintaining a secure server environment while the clients own the servers and claim full authority over the hardware and software. The space is typically leased by the U level, rack level , cabinet, or cage. The Colocation service provides the building, cooling, bandwidth, power, and physical security while the client provides the servers and storage.

However, the difference between Colocation service and cloud service is that the Colocation clients own hardware and lease space, while with the cloud services they do not have their hardware but lease it from the provider. 

Also, Colocation hosting is different from managed (dedicated) services, since the data center assumes management and maintenance control over the servers related to the managed services while with colocation hosting, the clients are the one who is responsible for supplying, maintaining, and managing their servers.

## Server Colocation Hosting Mechanism

Maintaining and managing servers is one of the biggest challenges faced by business organizations specially the enterprises since it involves expertise knowledge, time and capital and continuous commitment. Not being able to deal with “server-closets” means they are not functioning at full capacity and best is to opt for a data center colocation hosting for better performance.

Colocation as a service works best for businesses entities who already own hardware and software but are incapable of providing the conditions to store them. Hence, they opt to lease space from their service providers who offer housing for hardware, as well as environmental management.
Once the clients set up and configure their servers, there will be no physical contact between the data center and the clients’ hardware unless the client requests for “remote hands “assistance.

## The responsibilities of the Data center towards their colocation clients 

### Security

Data center ensures the upmost security and authorized access to the physical location by installing equipment such as cameras, biometric locks, and identification for any personnel on site so that no one without authorization can come close to the hardware. However, the clients are accountable for securing their servers against cyber-attacks. 

### Power

Uninterrupted and reliable power supply is key for the smooth functioning of a data center   Hence, the electricity power is ensured with UPS power and energy backups, such as generators, in case of a power outage. Similarly, the Power consumption is excessive in data center facility and power efficiency becomes an essential concern. OrionStellar Data center has adopted the latest technology and architectural designs to ensure that the PUE (Power usage effectiveness) is at its best with the highest uptime.

### Cooling

Data center means emission of a considerable amount of heat which needs to be balanced with the cooling mechanism. It is the responsibility of the facility management to provide advanced redundant cooling systems, so servers run optimally. OrionStellar, with its in-raw cooling technology ensures the optimum cooling and efficient power usage through which there is a huge cost saving while it prevents damage and extends the life of clients’ hardware.
